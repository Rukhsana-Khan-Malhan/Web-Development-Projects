                <p>Climate change refers to long-term alterations in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric  conditions on Earth. While some climate variations occur naturally, human activities, particularly the   burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial emissions, have accelerated global warming.</p>
                <p>The primary cause of climate change is the release of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and   methane, which trap heat in the atmosphere. This leads to rising global temperatures, melting ice caps,   rising sea levels, and extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires.</p>
                <p>The effects of climate change are widespread, impacting ecosystems, agriculture, wildlife, and human   health. It threatens food security, increases the frequency of natural disasters, and disrupts weather patterns worldwide.</p>
                <p>To combat climate change, individuals and governments must take action by reducing carbon emissions,   transitioning to renewable energy sources, conserving forests, and promoting sustainable practices. Every effort, big or small, can help mitigate the impact and protect the planet for future generations.</p>
